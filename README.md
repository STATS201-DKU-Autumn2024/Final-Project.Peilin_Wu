## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth
This project has significantly contributed to my understanding of machine learning in the context of financial applications, particularly in portfolio optimization. Through the development of this model, I have gained hands-on experience with advanced techniques such as diffusion models, transformer networks, and sentiment analysis. This process has not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the ethical challenges in financial decision-making. By combining these tools, I have learned how to navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market while ensuring fairness and transparency in algorithmic trading.

## Navigation Instructions

### Code for Simulations and Visualizations
All the simulation and visualization code can be found in the `code/` folder. You will find notebooks that explore different aspects of the data and model:

- **Simulations**: `simulation_notebook.ipynb`
- **Visualizations**: `visualization_notebook.ipynb`

### Datasets and Preprocessing Steps
The raw datasets (Bitcoin and Dogecoin historical price and sentiment data) are available in the `data/` folder. Preprocessing steps include data normalization, noise addition for diffusion modeling, and time-series alignment.

### Documentation and Dependencies
Documentation is included within the `docs/` folder for a detailed description of the methodology, model architecture, and results.

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following:


pip install -r requirements.txt
