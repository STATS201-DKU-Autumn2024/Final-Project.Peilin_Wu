# Overview
This project provides an integrated machine learning pipeline which can predict Bitcoin prices using a combination of diffusion models for noise handling and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for time series forecasting. The model is designed to provide investment suggestions, advising whether to take a long or short position in Bitcoin based on its predicted price movements to reach a low fluctuation. Key tasks include data collection, preprocessing, model training, and generating investment advice.
