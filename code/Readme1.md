# Overview
This project provides an integrated machine learning pipeline which can predict Bitcoin prices using a combination of diffusion models for noise handling and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for time series forecasting. The model is designed to provide investment suggestions, advising whether to take a long or short position in Bitcoin based on its predicted price movements to reach a low fluctuation. Key tasks include data collection, preprocessing, model training, and generating investment advice.

# Files Included
Untitled24.ipynb\
This is the main notebook that includes the following components:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Loading and processing Bitcoin price data along with sentiment analysis data.\
Diffusion Model: A diffusion model to denoise the price data.\
LSTM Model: A Long Short-Term Memory model for time series prediction of Bitcoin prices.\
Training and Evaluation: Code to train the models and output predictions and suggestions for investment strategies.\
Data/bitcoin0.csv\
Contains historical Bitcoin price data including time, open, close, high, low prices, and volumes.\

Data/google trends/geoMapbitcoin.csv \
Contains sentiment data based on Google Trends for Bitcoin, used for enhancing predictions.
