# Full Report: Machine Learning Model for Cryptocurrency Hedge Recommendations

## 1. Background and Motivation

The cryptocurrency investment sector is currently experiencing a surge in activity, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing markets globally (Almeida & Gonçalves, 2023a; Białkowski, 2020; Fang et al., 2021). An increasing number of investors are drawn to this newly emerging market due to its high investment potential, decentralized nature, ability to hedge against inflation, and potential to mitigate risks. Despite these advantages, significant concerns about the reliability of cryptocurrencies remain, particularly in countries with large investor populations such as the United States. A recent survey reveals that 63% of Americans are not confident in the safety and reliability of cryptocurrencies ("Majority of Americans Aren’t Confident in the Safety and Reliability of Cryptocurrency," 2024).

The primary concerns about cryptocurrencies include their high volatility and potential for pricing bubbles, which contribute to distrust and hesitation among potential investors (Corbet, Lucey, & Yarovaya, 2018). While some studies have explored ways to mitigate this volatility, existing machine learning techniques and datasets often fall short in terms of sophistication and comprehensibility for non-expert users (Wang, Andreeva, & Martin-Barragan, 2023). To address these issues, this report proposes the development of a machine learning model that combines crawler algorithms, diffusion models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and large language models (LLMs) to provide understandable hedge recommendations, specifically aimed at maintaining a maximum drawdown rate of 10%.

### Key Objectives:
- **Develop a machine learning model** that integrates historical cryptocurrency volatility, trading volumes, market sentiment, and advanced algorithms (including diffusion models and LSTM).
- **Provide actionable hedge recommendations** that are comprehensible for both casual investors and financial institutions, ensuring a maximum drawdown rate of 10%.
- **Enhance investment confidence** by offering reliable, understandable, and low-risk cryptocurrency investment strategies.

## 2. Research Question

The central research question guiding this study is:

- **How can an integrated machine learning model leveraging data on historical cryptocurrency volatility, trading volumes, market sentiment, and advanced algorithms (including diffusion models and LSTM) provide comprehensible hedge recommendations for investors while maintaining a maximum drawdown rate of 10%?**

This question aims to address the limitations in previous research, such as outdated machine learning models, insufficient datasets, and a lack of comprehensibility for average investors (Wang, Andreeva, & Martin-Barragan, 2023).

## 3. Application Scenario

The proposed model is designed to assist both civilians and financial institutions in making cryptocurrency investment decisions. The following applications are anticipated:

- **For Ordinary Investors**: Help individuals integrate cryptocurrencies into their portfolio management with lower volatility and higher reliability.
- **For Financial Institutions**: Enable institutions to manage cryptocurrency-related risks and recommend hedging strategies that maximize profit while minimizing losses in volatile markets.
  
Moreover, the model supports the growing trend of financial decentralization and can serve as a crucial tool for retail investors facing high inflation rates.

# Appendix

## Diffusion Model

### Explanation:
A **diffusion model** is a type of probabilistic model that simulates the spread of information, values, or behaviors across a network. In the context of this study, diffusion models are used to smooth and denoise the raw data before feeding it into machine learning algorithms. They help capture the underlying structure of the data by accounting for the spread of market behaviors and trends, reducing noise and enhancing the signal that predictive models like LSTM can use to make more accurate forecasts.

### Key Features:
- **Noise Reduction**: Diffusion models are effective at removing random fluctuations (noise) in data, which can improve the quality of predictions.
- **Data Smoothing**: By iteratively adjusting the data according to a probabilistic process, they can smooth out irregularities that may distort the results.
  
## LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Network

### Explanation:
An **LSTM network** is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. It is particularly effective at processing and predicting sequences of data, making it ideal for time-series forecasting, such as predicting cryptocurrency price volatility. LSTMs have memory units that store information over long periods, allowing them to capture long-term dependencies in data.

### Key Features:
- **Time-Series Prediction**: LSTM is well-suited for forecasting tasks where the data exhibits temporal patterns, such as financial market movements.
- **Long-Term Dependencies**: It can retain information from earlier time points, which is important for understanding long-term trends in cryptocurrency prices and volatility.
